							<h3>Aura Cleansing</h3>
							<p>
								Aura Cleansing is a great way to detox after a hectic day or week of work.
								Especially if you're a Counselor, Psychologist or Therapist, you become a psychic waste basket.
								for your clients who dump their negative energies. Dump the dump and have a fresh outlook for the next session. Don’t bring negative energy home from work and let it ruin your relationships.
							</p>

							<h2>Who am I?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							My name is Donald Neal Atkins and God does his work through me. I am a Pranic Psychotherapist, a person who applies
							pranic healing to mental health issues. I began practicing energy healing and taking courses at The Center for Pranic Healing in New Jersey
							in 1997. The Preventative Agency that I worked for at the time, paid for me to take Pranic Psychotherapy, which I successfully used with clients.
						</p>

						<p>
							In 2000 I suffered a bout of major depression after experiencing multiple losses within a very short period of time. Besides being depressed,
							I started to have auditory hallucinations that I told nobody about for many years. The minute that I recognized that I was having the auditory hallucinations, I started using energy work on myself,
							and I never heard the voices again.
